# Working with the Docs

Being able to quickly find information in documentation is an essential skill for any developer.  We will practice this skill today by using the docs to learn about different styling options for React.

First, pick a project that you want to style. For each of following options, style the project in this way.  Use a separate branch for each option.
- external style sheet (master)
- inline styles (inline)
- CSS modules (modules)
- Styled Components (components)

**Bonus**
- Tailwind (tailwind)
